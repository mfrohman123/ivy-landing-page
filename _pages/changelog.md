### `Initial Release`
# **Version 1.0**
Welcome to the first release of Ivy – a focused, elegant way to get things done.

Built on the Ivy Lee Method
Stay productive with a time-tested strategy: set up to six daily priorities and tackle them one by one.

Simple & Sleek Interface
No clutter, no distractions. Just a clean list of what matters today.

Smart Streaks & Gentle Nudges
Build momentum with daily streaks and reminders that motivate without nagging.

Private by Design
No logins, no cloud syncing. Your goals live on your device – and nowhere else.

Progress That Feels Good
Mark goals as done, in progress, or late. Track your completions and see your statistics. Celebrate your wins. Learn from your slips.
