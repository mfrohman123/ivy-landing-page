**Privacy Policy**

*Last updated: July 2, 2025*

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how our app handles your data.

### 1. **No Personal Data Collected**

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information. The app does not require an account or login, and no data is sent to our servers.

### 2. **Your Data Stays on Your Device**

All tasks, notes, and settings you create are saved locally on your device. We do not have access to this data, and you have full control over it.

### 3. **No Analytics or Tracking**

We do not use cookies, analytics tools, or any third-party tracking. Your usage is your business—not ours.

### 4. **External Links and Third-Party Services**
Our app may include links to external websites or services that are not operated or controlled by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly recommend reviewing the privacy policy of every site you visit.

We are not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or policies of any third-party websites or services.

Additionally, the app may include affiliate links, which may earn us a commission—at no extra cost to you. We are transparent about this practice and only recommend products or services we believe provide value.

### 5. **Security Measures and Optional Backups**
While no online or digital service can be guaranteed 100% secure, we are committed to safeguarding your information. We employ commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect any data stored on your device from unauthorized access or loss.

However, please be aware that no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

If you manually back up your device or app data (via your OS tools), those backups are handled by your device provider (e.g., iCloud, Google Drive). We have no access to or control over those services.

### 6. **Protection of Information**
We do not rent, sell, or trade personally identifiable information to third parties.

If any personally identifiable data is ever collected (e.g., through future updates or optional features), it will only be shared with employees or affiliated service providers who need access to deliver features or support. These parties are contractually bound to keep the information confidential and may be located outside your home country.

We may disclose information in response to legal obligations (e.g., subpoenas, court orders), to protect the rights and property of the app and its users, or to comply with evolving laws, regulations, or security standards.

### 7. **Policy Modifications**
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed about any changes. Continued use of the app after such updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
